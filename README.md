### About the project

A Simplistic social media platform made by me for learning purposes. Although lacking in features, it is fully responsive and most importantly fully working as of now. 
It has a recommendation system to recommend user friends which they are more likely to friend in future. The recommendation system is based on mutual recommendation. This feature is expected to be improved and features like recommendations based on interest is also to be added. 

The recommendation system is built using mongoDB Atlas Search. Backend is not done in vanilla NextJS instead, powerful and end-to-end typesafe Hono.js is used.

### What can you do ?
My idea is to build a simplistic social media platform. As of now following things are possible.
1. User authentication using JWTs (only email-password session is supported.)
2. Search for friends and other users
3. Recommendation system is in place to recommend you friends such as mutuals are more likely to be recommended.
4. Send Friend Request, Accept Friend Request, unfriend

### Plans for future
1. Improve UI
2. Add more metrics to recommendation system and expand its feature. Currently, it will recommend mutuals first.
3. Add interests sections and chatting functionality.
